The biggest motivation for me to change my career or *start* my career is that the tech industry is booming and the lifestyle I want aligns with benefits of persuing it.
  - The work to life balance is really good.
  - I get to solve problems and create things which is awesome!
  - I meet and interact with my coworkers. I love working in a team but also enjoy working alone too.
    - It really helps to solidify information if someone is stuck and I can walk them through or explain it.
  - The pay is really good in this industry.
  - I can make a good life for myself and my future family.
